## Multiple Programs

You can store multiple programs in memory, but each must be separated by the instruction `GTO 00` (or `GTO 000` on the HP 12c Platinum) at the end of each program. This command halts execution and sends the calculator back to line 0.

To run a specific program, press `g GTO`, enter the program's starting line number, then press `R/S` to execute it.

To make it easier to rerun a program without manually setting the start line each time, end your program with the instructions `R/S` followed by `GTO XX`, where `XX` is the program's starting line. For example, if your program starts at line 22 and ends at line 35, use `R/S` and `GTO 22` as the final two instructions. This makes the calculator return to the beginning of your program after each run, streamlining repeated executions.
